## Overview[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#overview)
### Solution[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#solution)
GitLab Dedicated combines the low overhead and efficiency of a SaaS platform with the flexibility and privacy benefits of self hosting. A single-tenant SaaS instance, fully managed and hosted by GitLab in any cloud region, is updated regularly to give you access to our latest product improvements — without the need to manage security, scalability, availability, and performance on your own. It's the offering of choice for enterprises and organizations in highly regulated industries that have complex regulatory, compliance, and data residency requirements. If you're a customer that's interested in Dedicated, make sure to also check-out [the website for Dedicated](https://about.gitlab.com/single-tenant-saas/).
### Background[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#background)
GitLab Dedicated's objective is to provide a GitLab SaaS offering to large enterprises and customers in industries with strict security and compliance requirements. When adopting DevOps tools, customers increasingly prefer SaaS to reduce operational cost, but customers in highly-regulated industries (e.g. Healthcare, Finance, and Public sectors) can't compromise on their security and compliance requirements when moving to SaaS. These requirements (e.g. isolated storage of source code IP) often dictate the need to be on separate Cloud Infrastructure from other tenants. This makes it challenging for these customers to adopt a shared-tenancy SaaS solution like GitLab.com.
Additionally, customers in regulated industries often require the ability to connect users or services running in their corporate network to their source code repositories running in the cloud via a private network connection. As a public-facing SaaS service, GitLab.com can't support this type of private connectivity easily by default. Finally, large, globally-distributed enterprises need the ability to control the location and number of Geo Replica sites to reduce latency for their workforce around the world. Some of our Self-Managed customers have 5+ Geo sites, and for them to consume SaaS they may need more global coverage than what we offer on GitLab.com today.
For these customers, a higher level of tenant isolation and deployment customization is required. While some customers may be satisfied leveraging a [partner MSP](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#channel-partner-role-in-gitlab-dedicated), customers may prefer to consume the service directly from GitLab so that they have a single-point of contact for operational accountability.
GitLab Dedicated will solve these needs by offering a fully isolated, private GitLab instance, deployed in the customer's cloud regions of choice. The instance is fully hosted and managed by GitLab Inc., enabling customers to offload operational overhead and focus on more business-critical tasks. GitLab Dedicated tenant operators (e.g. a system administrator) will retain the ability to quickly make changes to their Dedicated tenant's configurations in the course of their daily work using the [Switchboard](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/platforms/switchboard/) portal.
In addition to delivering customer value, GitLab Dedicated will also benefit internal GitLab teams. We envision the tooling we build for Dedicated being used as the single method going forward for running all of GitLab Inc.'s SaaS services. This will allow us to achieve even greater returns on our initial investment by enabling any future SaaS services to quickly get started with a robust and standardized foundation.
## Why is this important?[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#why-is-this-important)
There are two major trends emerging when it comes to the delivery of Cloud based solutions:
  * Move to SaaS as detailed in the .com strategy (IDC predicts that the market for SaaS-based DevOps tools (52% of the market in 2021) will continue to accelerate and account for **$20.0B in revenue** (or 61% of DevOps software tools market) by 2026).[1](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#footnotes)
  * Adoption of Private Cloud, which makes it easier for enterprises to meet their security and compliance needs. Increasing fragmentation of global policy [regarding data protection](https://insights.comforte.com/13-countries-with-gdpr-like-data-privacy-laws) drives new compliance requirements, which can be better met with Private Cloud deployments. 16% of cloud services are expected to be delivered as a hosted private cloud offering [by 2025](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05826094/Global-Private-Cloud-Server-Market.html?utm_source=PRN).


GitLab Dedicated is for organizations that want to benefit from both SaaS and Private Cloud. By delivering this offering we will set ourselves up to achieve customer success as these two trends further accelerate in 2025.
### Challenges to address[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#challenges-to-address)
Overall, the main challenge our target customer has is maintaining an up-to-date GitLab instance that fulfills their security and compliance requirements. More granular customer needs are documented in the sections below.
Note, this section does not reflect the list of currently available features within the GitLab Dedicated offering; rather, it contains the needs we're hearing from our customer base. The list of currently supported features in GitLab Dedicated is documented here: <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/#available-features>.
#### Migration[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#migration)
  * Users want to seamlessly migrate their data, which can exceed many TBs in size, to GitLab Dedicated in a timely and reliable fashion from their existing DevOps solution, whether it's a third-party offering like BitBucket, a self-managed GitLab instance, or GitLab.com.


#### Security and Compliance[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#security-and-compliance)
  * Our [target customer base](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#target-customer), large enterprises and customers in highly-regulated industries, expect the offering to implement security best practices including encryption of data at rest and in transit, periodic encryption key rotation, ability to specify their own encryption key, integration with their own identity management systems, protection against DDoS attacks, intrusion detection, role-based access control for operators, segregation of duties with least privilege access configured among operator accounts, and approved escalation in order to access customer environments during break-glass scenarios.
  * Upgrades: Customers want regular, zero-downtime upgrades to their instance along with timely security patches for high-sev issues when necessary.
  * Data residency/data sovereignty: Customers want their Dedicated instance and data (including logs and backups) to be hosted in their cloud region of choice to help meet their security and compliance requirements.
  * Private Networking: Customers want to be able to securely connect applications running in their VPC including their Runner pool to GitLab Dedicated via a private connection without the traffic leaving the Cloud Provider backbone.
  * Public Networking: Some customers work with third-parties (e.g. contractors), who do not authenticate through their main network and thus need to access the GitLab Dedicated instance over the public internet. In this scenario, customers need the ability to restrict access to their instance based on an allowlist of trusted IP ranges.


#### Observability[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#observability)
  * Customer admins want to access telemetry data including health metrics and application/system logs so that they can monitor their instance and keep their internal teams informed regarding an outage or performance degradations with their DevOps environment. Users also want access to audit logs to achieve compliance requirements and the ability to monitor network flow (e.g. VPC flow logs) to ensure outbound connections are made to only known/trusted hosts.


#### Scalability[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#scalability)
  * Large enterprises want their chosen DevOps solution to automatically scale based on their number of users and usage patterns.


#### Availability[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#availability)
Large enterprises demand strict uptime SLAs (at least 'three-nines') and expect the following capabilities related to system availability:
  * High Availability Deployment (especially their code repositories) including leveraging multiple availability zones within a region to mitigate against an AZ outage.
  * Disaster Recovery: Failovers to the included secondary site in case the primary instance experiences an unrecoverable outage and guaranteed recovery times.
  * Backups: customers expect their data to be backed up on a regular basis in case of a data loss event and to meet committed recovery point and time objectives during restoration.


#### Performance[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#performance)
  * Customers want replicas of their instance to be deployed in multiple regions around the globe to reduce latency for their global user base.


## Positioning[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#positioning)
### Target Customer[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#target-customer)
_Customer Requirements_
To be a good fit for Dedicated a customer **must** have the characteristics below:
  1. Require at least 1000 seats. Note: 500 seat opportunities will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
  2. Require the security and compliance features offered in the Ultimate tier.
  3. Require a single-tenant solution or has compliance requirements around data residency.


In addition to customers looking to solve the above [challenges](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#challenges-to-address), below are some additional characteristics of customers we are targeting with this offering:
**Target Customer Characteristics**

### Shared Responsibility[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#shared-responsibility)
As a SaaS solution, our customers should not have to worry about the details of operating GitLab. The goal is for them to have minimal management overhead. Having said that, the successful operation of GitLab Dedicated still requires a shared responsibility.
_GitLab Dedicated Responsibility_
  1. Managing updates of underlying software such as PostgreSQL, Kubernetes, Redis, OpenSearch, and GitLab itself
  2. Infrastructure operational monitoring and incident response
  3. Capacity planning based on historical trends
  4. Ensuring the Security of the Infrastructure and Network layer


_Customer Responsibility_
  1. Adhering to performance GitLab practices, including but not limited to:
  2. Only storing [large blobs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/monorepos/#large-blobs) with [_Large File Storage (LFS) objects_](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/lfs/index.html)
  3. For large [monorepos](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/monorepos/index.html) (larger than several gigabytes), reducing concurrent clones wherever possible, especially in CI/CD pipelines, to avoid potential bandwidth saturation
  4. Avoiding large spikes in concurrent CI jobs (e.g. hundreds launching at the same time of day)
  5. Limiting hundreds of concurrent CI jobs for [large repositories](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/monorepos/index.html)
  6. Optimizing custom scripts that run at high frequency
  7. Managing [integrations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/index.html) in many large projects
  8. Properly configuring [server hooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/server_hooks.html)
  9. Carefully implementing [system hooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/system_hooks.html)
  10. Implementing best practices for Security at the [application layer](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/security-hygiene-best-practices-for-gitlab-users/) such as least privilege access


### Comparison to other Deployment Options[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#comparison-to-other-deployment-options)
On GitLab Dedicated, customers are the administrators of their instance with full access to the [Admin area](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/) of their tenant. This is different from GitLab.com, where administration is owned by the GitLab Infrastructure team.
Availability will not be a point of differentiation between GitLab Dedicated and GitLab.com as both offerings target a 99.95% Availability SLA.
**See below for a comparison of the different ways to deploy GitLab:**
![alt text](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/Deployment_Options_GitLab_Dedicated.png)
## Where we are Headed[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#where-we-are-headed)
Now that GitLab Dedicated has graduated from Limited Availability to General Availability, it can scale to meet the expected customer demand of the service. Customers who want a production-quality GitLab Dedicated instance and are willing to pay for it can now get one.
Next, we plan to focus on improving the onboarding and configuration management experiences by delivering the Switchboard management console. Additionally, we plan to add several highly requested features that were deferred in the lead up to GA. See the roadmap section below for more details.
### Prioritization Framework[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#prioritization-framework)
Because Dedicated is a SaaS offering, we prioritize "Keep the lights on" activities (e.g. operating customer environments, tech debt, and corrective actions) above all else to ensure we provide customers a high level of service that continually meets our [platform SL0](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure/team/gitlab-dedicated/slas/#current-service-level-objective).
When it comes to customer feature requests, we prioritize features that [will benefit the most customers](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#using-the-rice-framework). As a result, we will not build any custom capabilities or one-off features for individual customers. This includes not making modifications to individual tenants. Feature requests that meet our prioritization criteria but are not currently on the roadmap will be slotted in [after other committed roadmap items](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#roadmap) have been delivered. For more information about feature requests for Dedicated, see the [feature request tracking issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/Product/-/issues/13856).
Priority | Category | Description  
---|---|---  
1 | KTLO - On Call | Operating Tenant Production Environments, Handling new tenant onboarding and config change requests  
2 | Security, Reliability, Performance | Initiatives tied to increasing overall security (e.g. third party compliance certifications and addressing security findings), reliability (including improvements to Availability SLAs and disaster recovery procedures and targets), and scalability (ability to better scale underlying tenant infrastructure to support new customers as well as existing tenants ad their workloads and usage patterns increase)  
3 | Automation | Reduce toil required to operate the GitLab Dedicated platform and improve internal developer experience  
4 | Customer Feature Requests | Delivering new customer-facing platform capabilities as well as enabling GitLab functionality such as Pages, advanced search, reply-by email, service desk  
5 | Technical Debt | Initiatives tied to increasing speed of development, overall efficiency

### Supporting AI Features on GitLab Dedicated[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#supporting-ai-features-on-gitlab-dedicated)
GitLab [AI features](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/gitlab_duo/index.html) improve DevSecOps workflow efficiency and velocity by applying AI assisted workflows to all teams involved in delivering software value.
As a cloud-based Saas service, GitLab Dedicated is a natural fit to deliver cloud-based AI services to customers. However, as a single-tenant service we need to design a solution that maintains single-tenancy and does not compromise on customer compliance requirements like data residency and isolation, and predictability.
Short term, our goal is to bring AI features to GitLab Dedicated starting with Code Suggestions, followed by Suggested Reviewers. That effort can be tracked [via this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10516).
Long term, our vision is to design native AI capbilities for single-tenant SaaS deployments. This may include training models inside tenant environments to generate tailored insights and suggestions while keeping data private. This will allow enterprises and regulated industries to more easily adopt AI-assisted workflows while maintaining compliance requirements around data residency, privacy, and isolation.
While we don't have any specific timelines to share for bringing all AI features to GitLab Dedicated at this time, as these features become Generally Available, we will be working on a plan to enable them in GitLab Dedicated.
#### Parity between self-managed, multi-tenant SaaS and Dedicated[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#parity-between-self-managed-multi-tenant-saas-and-dedicated)
GitLab strives to maintain [parity between self-managed and SaaS](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#parity-between-saas-and-self-managed-deployments). This can be challenging for certain features, like AI. From a Dedicated perspective, we adhere to the following principles:
  1. We intend to make all AI features available to all platforms. We want to solve customer problems on all platforms.
  2. In line, with our [SaaS First](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-principles/#saas-first) principle, GitLab Dedicated may support certain features before self-managed.
  3. GitLab Dedicated may offer additional features if there are technical or other limitiations that don't allow us to release them for self-managed customers.


## Go-to-market plans[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#go-to-market-plans)
### Guidelines for Engaging Customers at GA[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#guidelines-for-engaging-customers-at-ga)
#### Qualify the customer:[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#qualify-the-customer)
  1. Review the [target customer profile](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#target-customer) to ensure it is a good fit
  2. Ensure that the customer meets the minimum seat count of 1000
  3. Review the [Technical Qualification guidelines](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/horse/technical-qualification-evaluation-questionnaire/) to ensure there is a technical fit.
  4. Review [pricing](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#pricing), as this will cost more than our other offerings


#### Create the opportunity in Salesforce:[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#create-the-opportunity-in-salesforce)
  1. In your SFDC opportunity, set the Intended Product Tier to Dedicated Ultimate OR include Dedicated in the Opportunity name. This is the most important step to ensure we have visibility into the Dedicated pipeline.
  2. Include number of Ultimate seats somewhere easily referenceable in your SFDC opportunity (such as the opportunity title) to make it clear that the deal is [qualified](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#qualify-the-customer).


#### When to engage the Dedicated team[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#when-to-engage-the-dedicated-team)
_Account teams (Sales leads and SAs) should give the initial pitch of Dedicated to their customers using the materials on the[Dedicated Page in Highspot](https://gitlab.highspot.com/items/636ea5092603d0ca437fcae1). This allows the Product team to spend more time supporting Dedicated deals that are further along in the sales cycle._
  1. Technical questions and unique customer requirements 
     * After the account team gives the initial pitch, if the opportunity progresses and the customer has technical questions or requirements for the service that cannot be answered by [the documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_dedicated/) or the [technical qualification guidelines](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/horse/technical-qualification-evaluation-questionnaire/), please reach out to the Dedicated team in the `#f_gitlab_dedicated` channel so that they can help answer these questions. After that, if the questions are still not resolved and a sync meeting is needed, please open an issue in the [Dedicated issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/team/-/issues/) using the [Customer Meeting Template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/team/-/blob/main/.gitlab/issue_templates/customer_meeting_request.md) to request a call with the Dedicated team.
  2. Pricing Calculator Review 
     * Once the customer has been [qualified](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#qualify-the-customer) and they have expressed interest in moving forward with pricing, please use the [pricing calculator](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/horse/field-enablement/index.html#pricing) (internal only) to come up with a pricing estimate for the customer. Once you have completed the steps in the pricing calculator, reach out to the Dedicated Product team in the `#f_gitlab_dedicated` channel requesting a review. Also provide the [SFDC link](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#create-the-opportunity-in-salesforce) for this opportunity.


Note: _you must receive approval from the Dedicated Product team before sharing any pricing numbers with the customer and before creating a formal quote via Salesforce_

### Channel Partner Role in GitLab Dedicated[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/gitlab_dedicated/#channel-partner-role-in-gitlab-dedicated)
GitLab Dedicated creates a business opportunity for both GitLab and GitLab channel partners who offer hosted GitLab services. We are creating this offering to meet the needs of customers who want to consume hosted solutions directly from the DevOps vendor (in this case GitLab, Inc.) to more closely align operational and DevOps application needs. Customers who are interested in purchasing hosting services that include value-add managed services (for example, helping meet industry-specific specific requirements like HIPAA) would benefit from working with a Managed Service Provider (MSP) [Partner](https://partners.gitlab.com/English/directory/) Additionally, many customers have existing relationships with Channel Partners. Per the [services ROE](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/selling-professional-services/), these customers should continue consuming GitLab through their Channel Partner. By following the segmentation laid out above, we can minimize any disruption to existing [channel-sourced ARR](https://gitlab.my.salesforce.com/00O4M000004aqhB)(GitLab internal).
With this effort, we also see an opportunity to grow the overall market for GitLab-hosted services through collaboration with partners. In the short-term we plan to enable MSP partners with [design guidance and certifications](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/-/epics/1) (GitLab Internal) so that they can offer better hosted GitLab solutions for their customers. We will work with the GitLab Channel Partner team to create a partner certification that will provide MSP partners with technical certifications, training, deployment and maintenance guidelines, and access to some of the same underlying tooling that powers GitLab Dedicated (e.g. GitLab Environment Toolkit and official Reference Architectures). We plan to keep the other underlying services (e.g. Switchboard and Amp) as well as the `GitLab Dedicated` branding proprietary to GitLab, Inc. Longer-term opportunities for consideration include enabling partners [to resell GitLab Dedicated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/team/-/issues/499)(GitLab internal). These partners would provide customers value-added services or integrated vendor stacks while the GitLab Dedicated team would still host the GitLab instance on behalf of the partner.
