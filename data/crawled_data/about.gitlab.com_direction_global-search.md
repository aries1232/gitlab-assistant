### Useful terms[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#useful-terms)
Term | Definition  
---|---  
**Context** | Data that can be used to enhance the quality of LLM responses and was not in the model's training data. This allows LLMs to draw a wider body on knowledge than their training corpus.  
**Local Context** | Refers to context that is stored on an end-user's machine, such as local files or code in their IDE.  
**Server-side Context** | Refers to context that is outside the scope of an end-user's machine, such as remote code repositories or issues. Server-side context is accessible via a customer's GitLab instance.  
**RAG** | Stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a technique that combines information retrieval from a knowledge base with language generation to produce more accurate and contextually relevant AI responses. [Read more about RAG](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/generative-ai/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation-and-what-does-it-do-for-generative-ai/).  
**Relevance** | In search and information retrieval, relevance refers to the degree to which a returned result matches the user's query intent and satisfies their information need.  
## Overview[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#overview)
Global Search is the foundation for intelligent information retrieval across GitLab, unifying diverse data sources to provide rich search features for users and context for AI-powered features. It enables users to quickly find relevant information, while empowering internal teams with a scalable framework for accessing context to build and enhance AI capabilities throughout the platform. This centralized approach to search and context accelerates development, improves decision-making, and enhances the overall GitLab experience.
Global Search caters to two distinct personas, end-users of GitLab and GitLab developers:
### For End-users[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#for-end-users)
  * **[Advanced search](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/advanced_search.html)** , available for GitLab Premium self-managed, GitLab Premium SaaS, and higher tiers, expands the scope of searchable content, provides advanced filtering options, and enables cross-project and cross-group code search. It will also be the source for similarity search backed by vector embeddings. For self-managed instances, Advanced search requires integration with either [Elasticsearch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/elasticsearch.html) or [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/), to enable these more powerful and flexible search capabilities. Advanced search enables us to provide many benefits:
    * **Global GitLab search** , allowing search across your entire GitLab instance for code, MRs, issues, epics, and more
    * **Significantly improved performance** , in the form of significantly lower latency and increased result relevance
    * **Horizontal scalability** , maintaining high performance even as the size of your GitLab instance grows.
  * **[Basic search](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/#basic-search)** is the default mode for GitLab, requiring no additional setup. While it offers a seamless setup experience, its feature set is limited compared to its more advanced counterpart. For example, global code search is not available, nor is cross-group or cross-project searching of code. Basic search uses Postgres text search, which can be slower for medium-large and larger datasets. It also doesn't support advanced text analysis features like relevance scoring, and as such will have lower qualtiy results.


### For GitLab developers[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#for-gitlab-developers)
Global Search provides a centralized framework and interface for accessing, indexing, and retrieving context and traditional search results across GitLab. This enables teams to build context- or search-powered features that leverage GitLab's rich data ecosystem. Key benefits include:
  * **Unified context access** : A single layer for retrieving relevant context and search results from various GitLab data sources, such as code, merge requests, issues, epics, and comments.
  * **Scalability** : Built to handle large volumes of data and concurrent requests efficiently, so developers don't need to worry about how to scale the architecture
  * **Ease of integration** : Easily index, embed, and search data from new and existing sources to meet customer needs.
  * **Continuous improvement** : Ongoing enhancements to context relevance and retrieval interfaces.


## What we recently completed[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#what-we-recently-completed)
  * [Hybrid search for GitLab issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/440424), including foundational infrastructure work allowing embeddings to be generated and kept up to date via the AI Gateway
  * [PoC with Code Creation team](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/editor-extensions/gitlab-lsp/-/issues/263) to provide server-side context to Code Suggestions

## What we are currently working on[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#what-we-are-currently-working-on)
While we will adjust our investment allocation based on the [new strategy laid out below](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#vision--fy25-h2-and-fy26), the below represents what we're actively working on today.
### Investment allocation[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#investment-allocation)
Category | Allocation  
---|---  
Context | 60%  
Advanced search framework | 10%  
Performance optimization | 20%  
Usability and feature depth | 5%  
Work Items migration support | 5%  
### Context[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#context)
As we continue to develop our Advanced search capabilities, we're increasingly leveraging search to enhance AI functionality. Our goal is to implement [hybrid search capabilities](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11748) across GitLab, combining traditional keyword-based search with AI-powered methods like semantic search. Combining the methods allows us to broaden our query with the semantic understanding of vector search, while maintaining the accuracy of exact term matches.
We're continuing to develop more vector embedding pipelines for [vector embeddings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/ai_features/embeddings.html), currently focusing on code embeddings for Code Suggestions. This infrastructure will allow us to generate, store, retrieve, and update vector representations of content across GitLab. These embeddings are crucial for enabling semantic search and other advanced AI-powered features, allowing us to capture and compare the meaning and context of both queries and content.
Finally, we continue our work to [scale Zoekt code search to our largest customers](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/13923). The addition of Zoekt to our hybrid search will offer increased relevance for features like Code Suggestions.
### Advanced search interfaces[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#advanced-search-interfaces)
For our development teams, we're focusing on [simplifying the integration of Advanced search across GitLab](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/13873). Our goal is to make it as easy as possible for feature teams to incorporate powerful search capabilities into their work. This involves creating intuitive APIs, providing clear documentation, and offering support to teams as they implement search features.
We'll also [update our abstraction layer for Elasticsearch and OpenSearch to support embeddings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/454764) in OpenSearch, so self-managed customers running OpenSearch can utilize features reliant on vector search.
### Performance optimization[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#performance-optimization)
For our SaaS deployments, performance optimization is a key focus. We're working on [migrating inefficient searches to Elasticsearch](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/13112), which offers superior speed and accuracy for large-scale search operations. Once complete, this migration will help improve database scalability by allowing us to move heavy production queries onto Elasticsearch, for example, merge request text searches.
Beyond this migration, we're committed to maintaining high performance and reliability standards across all our search functions. This involves ongoing monitoring and proactive optimizations to ensure that our search capabilities can scale with our users' needs.
### Usability and feature depth[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#usability-and-feature-depth)
The user interface and overall user experience of our search functionality are critical to its success. We're continuously working to [improve the command palette](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12031), making it more intuitive and powerful. The command palette serves as the primary access point for search and other actions, and its refinement will help users navigate GitLab more efficiently.
We're also collaborating closely with feature teams across GitLab to [improve search UX consistency across the product](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/2656). This will involve creating and implementing design guidelines, gathering and acting on user feedback, and ensuring that search behaves predictably and effectively no matter where in GitLab a user encounters it.
### Work Items migration support[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#work-items-migration-support)
As noted [above](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#what-we-recently-completed), we recently completed the [Work Items migration of epics to the issue table](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/12903), however the Plan team is continuing it's migration to Work Items, and we continue to be downstream of that work and will have ongoing migration efforts required to support it.
## Vision : FY25-H2 and FY26[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#vision--fy25-h2-and-fy26)
The search landscape is currently being transformed rapidly by developments in AI, making the future impossible to predict. Even as LLMs with million-token context windows are being built for research, we believe a real and significant gap exists between them and what is commercially viable in the medium-term. The foreseeable future is barely so, and constantly changing. But certain patterns, such as RAG, have emerged as relatively stable because they address real limitations of LLMs today. As such, 18 months seems a reasonable maximum duration to plan for, during which Global Search will strive to execute on lasting, high impact initiatives to improve GitLab's competitive market position.
Global Search aims to create and support transformative experiences within GitLab by intelligently connecting users to the information they need, whether through search directly, or by providing context to other features.
Our vision extends beyond traditional search capabilities; we see search as the foundation for enabling relevance-driven experiences that power AI-assisted features and empower users to take meaningful action on the information they discover.
We recognize an opportunity to reinvent the retrieval layer that underpins user experiences. This aligns with the broader industry trend towards more sophisticated, context-aware information systems. As the volume of data within GitLab instances continues to grow, the ability to quickly find and leverage relevant information becomes increasingly crucial for user productivity and satisfaction. Global Search is uniquely positioned within GitLab to lead this transformation.
### Objectives[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#objectives)

This set of metrics helps us understand how widely and effectively our Advanced search capabilities are being adopted by customers. By tracking cross-namespace searches, integration times, and overall adoption rates, we can assess the real-world impact of our search improvements and identify any barriers to adoption. They are vital for measuring the success of our go-to-market strategies and informing our product development priorities.
Metric | Description  
---|---  
Number of cross-namespace and cross-project searches | Tracks usage of Advanced Search's capability to search across multiple namespaces and projects.  
Time to complete Advanced search integration | Measures how long it takes customers to fully integrate Advanced Search into their workflow.  
Total self-managed customers with Advanced search | Counts the number of self-managed customers who have enabled Advanced Search.  
Percentage of eligible customers using Advanced search | Measures the adoption rate of Advanced Search among customers who are eligible to use it.  
Self-managed Advanced search seat count | Tracks the total number of user seats with access to Advanced Search in self-managed instances.  
Month-on-month growth in Advanced search customers | Measures the monthly increase in the number of customers using Advanced Search.  
#### Internal adoption measures[](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/global-search/#internal-adoption-measures)
These metrics focus on the uptake and integration of our server-side context capabilities within GitLab itself. By measuring the number of features using server-side context, integration times, and overall usage, we can assess how effectively we're leveraging search across the platform. These metrics aren't very automatable and so will be harder to collect, but are critical to understanding Global Search's impact and penetration.
Metric | Description  
---|---  
Features shipped using server-side context | Counts the number of GitLab features that have been released using the server-side context layer.  
Features scheduled to use server-side context | Tracks the number of upcoming features that plan to incorporate the server-side context layer.  
Teams using server-side context | Counts the number of internal GitLab teams leveraging the server-side context in their features.  
Time to integrate existing context type | Measures how long it takes teams to integrate an already-supported type of context (min, max, mean).  
Time to integrate new context type | Tracks the time required to integrate a completely new type of context (min, max, mean).  
Growth in server-side context retrieval requests | Measures the monthly increase in the number of requests made to the server-side context layer.
