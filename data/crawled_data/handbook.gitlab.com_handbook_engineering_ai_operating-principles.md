# Operating Principles
The Operating Principles for the AI Engineering groups. These principles define how we work together to deliver reliable features under tight timelines without sacrificing long-term maintainability.
## Purpose[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ai/operating-principles/#purpose)
Improve stability, predictability, and quality of the DAP codebase while implementing new functionality in a timely manner. These principles define how we work together to deliver reliable features under tight timelines without sacrificing long-term maintainability.
Short Summary of the Operating Principles
  1. **Reviews and Merge Discipline**
     * Every MR gets two reviewers from the relevant specialty. No single-review merges unless it’s an S1-level situation.
  2. **Quality Over Assumptions**
     * If something looks wrong or unclear, stop and ask. Pull in help rather than silently assuming it’s fine.
  3. **Test Coverage Enforcement**
     * Coverage jobs must pass for FE and BE changes. No exceptions.
  4. **No Pressure During the Reviewer Process**
     * Don’t rush or nudge reviewers with “we need this ASAP,” once the review process has started. If a deadline can’t hold, escalate instead of lowering review quality.
  5. **Shift from Speed to Stability**
     * We’re shifting from rush to stability. Small, clean, minimal changes beat large, risky ones.
  6. **Early Signal on Risks**
     * Raise delays, scope creep, unclear requirements, or blockers as soon as you spot them.
  7. **Strict AI-Assisted Coding Discipline**
     * AI is a helper, not an authority. Keep implementations simple. Understand every line you merge.
  8. **High-Bandwidth Communication**
     * If you foresee complexity, can’t review, or see improvements worth making, speak up immediately.
  9. **Backwards Compatibility**
     * Changes outside of the GitLab Instance, e.g. in the AI gateway or editor extensions, should still follow the backwards compatibility guidelines.


## Principles[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/ai/operating-principles/#principles)
  1. Reviews and Merge Discipline
     * Up until the code is considered stabilized (subject to another evaluation), all Merge Requests require at least two reviewers from the relevant specialty (BE or FE).
     * No single-review merges unless explicitly approved for high-severity (S1) fixes. Every MR has to have 2 approvals for the main functional discipline(s) of the MR (frontend and/or backend). Examples: 
       * if an MR requires both frontend and UX reviews, it’s expected to have 2 frontend reviews and 1 UX ([for MRs from teams that include a Product Designer](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/code_review/#reviewer-roulette))
       * if an MR requires both backend and frontend reviews it is expected to have 2 frontend and 2 backend reviews
  2. Quality Over Assumptions
     * If something in an MR looks incorrect, unclear, or suspicious, stop and escalate. Ask questions, start a thread, or bring key product or engineering stakeholders into the conversation when in doubt.
     * Never merge code you don’t fully understand or can’t defend.
     * Test code you review locally at all times and test again if late changes were made.
  3. Test Coverage Enforcement
     * Coverage jobs must run for every MR.
  4. No Pressure During the Reviewer Process
     * Do not pressure reviewers to “review quickly,” “merge ASAP,” or “just approve so we can move forward” after they have started the review.
     * Time pressure is never a justification for lowering review quality.
     * If the timeline genuinely cannot hold, escalate through technical leadership or engineering management instead of placing that pressure on individual reviewers.
     * Reviews must happen at a pace that preserves clarity, safety, and correctness.
     * It is acceptable, though, to nudge an assigned reviewer/maintainer if the review hasn’t been started in a timely manner, as defined in our documentation.
  5. Shift from Speed to Stability
     * The early phase prioritized shipping volume.
     * From now on, the priority is robustness, clarity, and correctness.
     * “Less is more” applies: small, focused, reliable changes are better than broad, risky ones.
  6. Early Signal on Risks
     * Communicate risks as soon as they appear: 
       * delays
       * scope creep
       * unclear requirements
       * dependencies blocking progress
     * Surfacing uncertainty early prevents compounding failures later.
  7. Strict AI-Assisted Coding Discipline
     * AI is a tool, not an authority.
     * When using AI for code:
     * Ask for straightforward, explicit, simple implementations.
     * Validate every line produced.
     * Challenge unclear or magical logic.
     * Only push to a branch what you personally understand end-to-end and agree with.
  8. High-Bandwidth Communication
     * If you foresee complexity in your task: speak up.
     * If you can’t review an MR promptly: speak up.
     * If you notice opportunities for simplification or improvement: speak up.
     * Silent uncertainty is more harmful than a wrong initial assumption.
  9. Backwards compatibility
     * Changes outside of the GitLab Instance, e.g. in the AI gateway or editor extensions, still need to comply with our general [Backwards Compatibility guidelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/multi_version_compatibility/) for GA features
     * Beta features must be backwards compatible with at least the last 3 minor versions of GitLab
     * If in doubt, verify with an older version of a self-managed instance, that your change does not break backwards compatibility. You can get access to dedicated instances [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/gitlab-dedicated/sandbox/bmckitrick/dap-test-admin#using-it).
