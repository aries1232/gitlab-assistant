# Incident Follow Up Issues
This page documents the process for managing follow-up items from incidents.
## Terminology[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/incident-follow-ups/#terminology)
  * **Follow Up Item** : Action items, bugs, or improvements identified during an incident that need to be addressed after the incident is resolved.
  * **Incident Lead** : The person responsible for coordinating the incident response and ensuring proper follow-up after resolution.
  * **Corrective Action** : A follow-up item aimed at preventing similar incidents in the future (synonymous with InfraDev for labeling purposes).
  * **InfraDev** : [Infrastructure development issues](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/workflow/#infradev) that affect the production platform.


## Default Issue Locations[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/incident-follow-ups/#default-issue-locations)
We use different default projects for incident follow-up issues based on privacy requirements and team structure:
### GitLab.com Team[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/incident-follow-ups/#gitlabcom-team)
  * **Default Location** : `gitlab-com/gl-infra/incident-follow-ups`
  * This project serves as the initial triage point for all follow-up items from GitLab.com incidents


### Dedicated Team[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/incident-follow-ups/#dedicated-team)
  * **Default Location** : `gitlab-com/gl-infra/dedicated-follow-ups`
  * This private project preserves confidentiality for customer-specific incidents


## Incident Lead Responsibilities[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/incident-follow-ups/#incident-lead-responsibilities)
Incident Leads have the following responsibilities for managing follow-up items:
  1. **During the Incident** :
     * Ensure all follow-up items are properly documented
     * Assign initial owners for each follow-up item where possible
  2. **After the Incident** :
     * Review all automatically created follow-up issues within 1 business day
     * Verify that each issue has appropriate context from the incident
     * Ensure each issue is moved to the correct project for the team that will address it
     * Apply appropriate labels including team and group labels
     * Assign the issue to the correct team member or manager for triage


## Issue Triage Process[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/incident-follow-ups/#issue-triage-process)
### For GitLab.com Incidents[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/incident-follow-ups/#for-gitlabcom-incidents)
  1. Follow-up items are automatically created in `gitlab-com/gl-infra/incident-follow-ups`
  2. To attach an existing GitLab issue to an incident as a follow up instead of creating a new one, paste the issue’s URL into the slack channel
  3. The Incident Lead reviews each issue and:
     * For infrastructure issues: Apply appropriate infrastructure team labels
     * For application issues: Move to `gitlab-org/gitlab` using the `/move` command
     * For service-specific issues: Move to the appropriate service project (e.g., `gitlab-org/gitaly` for Gitaly issues)
  4. Apply appropriate group/team labels:
     * Engineering team issues should include the group label (e.g. `group::database`)
     * Infrastructure team issues should include the team label (e.g. `team::database`)
  5. When moving an issue, ensure the `infradev` label is maintained on the issue


### For Dedicated Incidents[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/incident-follow-ups/#for-dedicated-incidents)
  1. Follow-up items are automatically created in `gitlab-com/gl-infra/dedicated-follow-ups`
  2. To attach an existing GitLab issue to an incident as a follow up instead of creating a new one, paste the issue’s URL into the slack channel
  3. The Incident Lead reviews each issue and:
     * Applies appropriate team labels
     * Ensures the issue has a clear owner
     * Maintains confidentiality by keeping customer-specific information in the private repository
  4. Only move issues if the Dedicated team requires a different location (for example, if it’s an issue that needs to be addressed by a team outside of the Dedicated organization)


## Tracking and Visibility[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/incident-follow-ups/#tracking-and-visibility)
To ensure no follow-up items fall through the cracks:
  1. **Weekly Triage** : The Production Engineering team performs a weekly triage of all open issues in the incident follow-up repositories to identify any untriaged items
  2. **SaaS Availability Reviews** : The status of critical incident follow-up items is reviewed in SaaS Availability meetings
  3. **Engineering Teams** : Engineering directors and managers are expected to regularly triage the `infradev` issues assigned to their teams


## Labels[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/incident-follow-ups/#labels)
The following labels are automatically applied to all incident follow-up issues in both repositories:
  * `infradev`: Applied to all follow-up issues
  * `corrective action`: Applied to all follow-up issues


Additional labels that should be manually applied:
  * Team labels (e.g., `team::database`, `team::observability`)
  * Group labels (e.g., `group::database`, `group::analytics`)


## Template and Issue Format[](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-management/incident-follow-ups/#template-and-issue-format)
Follow-up issues contain:
  1. A link to the original incident
  2. A link to the Post Incident Review (PIR) if one has been created
  3. Context from the incident
  4. A description of the required action
  5. Due date (if specified)


Incident Leads should ensure each issue contains:
  * Clear acceptance criteria
  * Sufficient context for someone unfamiliar with the incident to understand the issue
  * Links to relevant logs, metrics, or other evidence from the incident
